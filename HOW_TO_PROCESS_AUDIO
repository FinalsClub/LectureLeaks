This guide will explain how sync the LectureLeaks audio, process it and get it listed on LectureLeaks.com.

You will need:
    * A verison of FFMpeg with 3GPP/amrnb support compiled in.
        * This is a pain in the ass. This might help: http://blog.defunct.ca/2008/06/13/ffmpeg-mplayer-w-amr-nb-support-for-3gp/
    * A user account on the LectureLeaks.com server
    * A user account on LectureLeaks webapp.

Once you have FFMpeg compiled and installed, sync the files by making a script called sync.sh:

#! /bin/sh
rsync -vhza --progress lectureleaks.com:/var/www/LectureLeaks/uploads/documents/* ./

and chmod +x it.

Then: 

sync.sh > sept7

and it will download the files. This will take a long time the first time you do it. sept7 will then contain the transfer data.

Then go to lectureleaks.com/admin and look for new files which have school and lecture data, or look for large files (~4M or more).

For that file name, use this conversion scripts:

convert.sh:
#! /bin/sh
ffmpeg -i $1 -vcodec xvid -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 out.mp3

out.mp3 will then contain the lecture. Open it in vlc to make sure it sounds okay, then use the
admin interface to upload the mp3 to LectureLeaks. If the School doesn't exist yet, make sure that
you create that School entry in the database and check all of the checkboxes available to it.

If you have incomplete data for the descriptions of the files, try to use Google-fu to find out the
information necessary. Email me if you need help here.

Then upload the mp3, enter in the approrpiate data and approve it. It should now be available in the
lectures list.

Hooray!
